# Product Requirements Document

## Overview
Create a web server in Golang with HTMX integration to handle POST requests for real-time transcript processors as specified in the Omi.me documentation.

## Requirements
1. The server should accept POST requests at the endpoint `/transcript/process`.
2. The request body should follow the format specified in the Omi.me documentation for real-time transcript processors.
3. The server should validate the incoming request data.
4. The server should process the transcript data and return an appropriate response.
5. The server should use HTMX for dynamic content updates without full page reloads.
6. The server should handle errors gracefully and return appropriate error messages.

## API Specification
Based on the Omi.me documentation, the server should handle POST requests with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "text": "string",
    "speaker": "SPEAKER_XX",
    "speakerId": number,
    "is_user": boolean,
    "start": number,
    "end": number
  }
]
```

The response should acknowledge receipt of the transcript data.
